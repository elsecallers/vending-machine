This is a multipart project.

The first assignment is to implement the calculateChange method in the ChangeCalculator class.

1. This method returns an instance of the CoinCounts class. You can see how to create and use this class by looking at the [test cases](./src/test/java/CoinCountsTest.java).

2. The method takes in a float that is the amount of money that you need to make change for. This is a float representing dollars and cents. 

3. You must return the __minimum__ number of coins required to make change for the amount. 

4. You are allowed to work with half dollars, quarters, dimes, nickles and pennies. You can assume you can use as many of these as you need. 

Run the test cases in [ChangeCalculatorTests](./src/test/java/ChangeCalculatorTest.java) when you are done to check your solution.
